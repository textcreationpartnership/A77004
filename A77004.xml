         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Prayer</hi> of the Petition: and <hi>thorow it</hi> I muſt lead you a little further, into <hi>two particulars</hi> therin contained, which are,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>the matter</hi> prayed for, that is, <hi>Compaſſion, ſympathie:</hi> Have pitie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>the forme</hi> of the prayer; it is <hi>ſharpned</hi> and quickned, both <hi>with an Interjection,</hi> which ſhewes that his tongue was too
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125082:8"/>narrow for his heart, <hi>[O;]</hi> and with a <hi>double repetition,</hi> of the <hi>act,</hi> and of the <hi>object:</hi> Of the <hi>act, Pitie, Pitie;</hi> Of the <hi>object, Me, Me.</hi> The <hi>act</hi> is doubled, to ſhew that he had need of <hi>double pitie;</hi> The <hi>object,</hi> to ſhew that he had <hi>double need</hi> of that <hi>compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly and finally, <hi>the ground</hi> of the whole Petition, in the laſt clauſe: <hi>for the hand of God hath touched me:</hi> where note</p>
            <p>The <hi>author,</hi> or inflicter, <hi>God:</hi> which ſhewes his ſorrow to be <hi>divine;</hi> and from above: and not ſo much a puniſhment for ſin, as an affliction, and triall, but withall <hi>unavoydable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then the <hi>inſtrument,</hi> (if I may ſo call it) <hi>his hand,</hi> which ſignifieth the <hi>weight;</hi> one of his fingers being more heavie then the whole loynes of the greateſt of men, eſpecially, when that hand doth <hi>touch him,</hi> that is, <hi>touch him home,</hi> and to the <hi>quick:</hi> for ſo you may here underſtand that expreſſion. The more full explanation of all theſe termes may bee given anon, when I ſhall againe fetch them about in my application. For preſent only thus much.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>divine precepts</hi> from <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>
               <note place="margin">Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, by</note> Secondly, <hi>humane preſidents</hi> from <hi>the Saints:</hi> both theſe doe ſtrengthen my aſſertion.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:125082:9"/>
            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</note> 
               <hi>Divine precepts;</hi> This booke of <hi>Job</hi> ſeemes to have recorded this ſame text more then once. <hi>To him that is afflicted,</hi> (or to him that <hi>melteth) pitie ſhould be ſhewed from his friends.</hi> The former part of the verſe ſeemeth to be the ground of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<note place="margin">Iob 6.14.</note> namely, <hi>becauſe</hi> he is afflicted, therefore his friends ſhould pitie him. And the <hi>neglecter</hi> of this dutie is charged with no leſſe then <hi>want of the feare of God,</hi> in the cloſe of the verſe; <hi>but hee forſaketh the feare of the Lord. Hee, i.e.</hi> the man which omitteth this friendly office.</p>
            <p>Next, to ſhew how received, and <hi>common a truth</hi> this is: the ſpirit of God ſpeaking by the <hi>wiſeſt of Kings</hi> doth turne it into a <hi>common proverbe,</hi> ſetting it downe among the reſt, <hi>A friend</hi> (that is, as a friend) <hi>loveth</hi> (or ought to love) <hi>at all times, and a brother</hi> (whether naturall,
<note place="margin">Pro. 17.17.</note> civill, or ſpirituall,) <hi>is borne for adverſitie;</hi> So then, compaſſion in diſtreſſe is a principall both <hi>act,</hi> and <hi>duty</hi> of friendſhip. Nay the wiſe man hath a <hi>ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>A man that hath friends</hi> (eſpecially if diſtreſſed) <hi>muſt ſhew himſelfe friendly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.24.</note> (chiefly in compaſſion) <hi>and there is a friend that ſticketh cloſer then a brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is ſpecially a <hi>Goſpell-precept;</hi> heare the Doctor of the Gentiles,
<note place="margin">Rom. 12.10.</note> 
               <hi>be kindly affectioned one to another, with brotherly love;</hi> (or in the love of brethren.) But this <hi>inward impreſſion,</hi> muſt have its <hi>outward expreſſion</hi> too, <hi>diſtributing to the neceſſities of the Saints,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> that is, <hi>making things common,</hi> both good and evill, wants and fulnes:
<note place="margin">Verſ. 15.</note> Then it followes, <hi>reioyce with them that reioyce, and weepe with them that weepe;</hi> that is, hold a <hi>Chriſtian ſympathy</hi> with your brethren on both hands; in proſperity, <hi>with them that rejoyce;</hi> and in adverſitie, <hi>with them that weepe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Alſo ſee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes: Let brotherly love continue.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.1, 2, 3</note> 
               <hi>Be not forgetfull to entertain ſtrangers.

            </p>
            <p>For the firſt, let me ſay,

Beſides, in the laſt times, ſince theſe troubles began, the extraordinarie <hi>cryes</hi> to heaven, and ſeekings to God, publikely, privatly, with prayer, faſting, and teares, in many places were ſuch, as would (I thinke) have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the moſt adverſe Anti-weſterne ſpirit to confeſſe, that there was much of the <hi>feare of God in thoſe places.</hi> But all this I ſhall paſſe, and would adde but one onely conſideration; and that is,

                  <hi>Multitudes baniſhed. About</hi> 500 <hi>exiles from</hi> Devon <hi>and</hi> Exon <hi>alone are in theſe parts.</hi>

His ſubſtance alſo was ſeven thouſand ſheep, and three thouſand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred ſhee-aſſes, and a very great houſhold; ſo that this man was the greateſt of all the men of the Eaſt.</hi> And ſurely the Weſt for populouſneſſe,
<note place="margin">The Weſt.</note> might well have borrowed that old title of the North; as it was called <hi>[officina hominum]</hi> the ſhop of men: It was the populous <hi>No</hi> of the kingdome, whoſe ſtreets and fields <hi>were ſowne with the ſeed of man, and the ſeed of beaſts;</hi> as hath appeared too well ſince the beginning of theſe warres.

So much in generall.</p>
            <p>But wee will now trace the ſteps of this cruelty towards <hi>Iob</hi> in 'its particulars, giving our Weſterne parallels as wee goe.</p>

Therefore the <hi>Time</hi> is remarkable: ſo alſo is the <hi>Manner,</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering</hi> of this ſtroke very obſervable.

            <p>Alas, poor Weſt! in this thing alſo canſt thou compare too well: Have not the armies of thine enemies taken their ſucceſſive <hi>turnes</hi> at thee? When a well-affected Towne or Pariſh had firſt been <hi>plowed</hi> by their owne Malignant Gentry and neighbours, (as by the <hi>Sabeans</hi>) with heavie fines and amercements; then come other forces, that were raiſed in Counties farther off, and they doe <hi>harrow</hi> them by weekly taxes, and free-quarter: when theſe are called away, then, thirdly, the French, Iriſh, and other Foreiners, a people of a ſtrange Language, (like the <hi>Caldeans</hi>) are ſent upon them; and theſe by their cruell plundrings doe, as it were, <hi>breake the clods</hi> by parties and degrees, as thoſe <hi>Caldeans</hi> made out three bands: The <hi>firſt</hi> drives away the husband-mans cattle, which he may redeeme againe for a ſumme of money: that is no ſooner done, but a <hi>ſecond</hi> band cometh, and driveth them againe, requiring another ranſome; which the poor owner hath no ſooner made up by borrowing, pawning, and begging, but anon cometh the <hi>third</hi> band, and they doe finally ſweep away all this thrice purchaſed ſtock and ſtuffe, there being no more abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity left to buy them againe a <hi>fourth</hi> time. And theſe ſeverall bands of the enemie, are like thoſe <hi>three ſwords</hi> of <hi>Hazael, Jehu,</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:125082:29"/>and <hi>Eliſha,</hi> of which 'tis ſaid, <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe,</hi>

Satan ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a ſecond commiſſion; by which he hath power to lay any torment upon him on this ſide death, and he follows it to the purpoſe: <hi>So went Satan forth from the preſence of the Lord.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Mr. Caryl ad loc.</note> There are (ſaith one) divers aggravations of his affliction in that verſe; as firſt, if wee conſider the <hi>Chirurgion;</hi> he could get, it ſeems, none to dreſſe him; nor wife, nor ſervants, nor friends would meddle with him, but himſelfe is faine to be his owne Chirurgion: <hi>he took [him.]</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, obſerve the <hi>toole,</hi> or dreſſing inſtrument which he doth uſe, it was a <hi>ſheard,</hi> (as wee call it) either becauſe he was loath to touch his loathſome fleſh with his hand, or becauſe his boyles did ſo over-ſpread his hands to the very nailes, that it was a paine to him to touch himſelfe: <hi>he tooke a [potſheard.]</hi> Thirdly, the <hi>lodging</hi> or pallet he had to reſt upon in this noiſome grievous

And yet ſuch is the terrour of preſent imminent death, (the King of feares) that divers <hi>godly perſons,</hi> through infirmity, have entangled themſelves, verbally, with that bloudy combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but, after the taking thereof, ſome of them have been <hi>diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi> with the terrours of their clamorous conſciences; others have loſt their comfort and activity, the very wheeles of their ſoules, and doe lock up themſelves in darkneſſe. Brethren, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Hoſpitals</hi> in this City, for ſuch ſouldiers as have been woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and maimed in theſe warres, where there is proviſion of food, phyſicke, and Chirurgeons, made for their bodies; and doubtleſſe that worke is an act of much equity, prudence, and mercy: But alas, alas! how many <hi>Savoys</hi> and <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> I mean, <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> and <hi>Spittles,</hi> ſhall wee need for wounded conſciences, and maimed ſoules in the Weſt? Surely, I am perſwaded, that if ever the Lord doth turne our captivity, and brings us backe into thoſe parts, wee ſhall meet with ſpirituall wounds, ulcers, and broken bones, of all ſorts and degrees: there wee ſhall have <hi>one</hi> crying out, (like hopeleſſe <hi>Spiia</hi>) <q>I have denyed God before men, and now am I ſure to be denyed of him before his Angels in heaven;</q> the wound of mine Apoſtacy is incurable. <hi>Another</hi> roaring out becauſe of his perjury, and ſaying, <q>Which ſide ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is in the right, I am certainly a forſworne man; becauſe I have taken Oaths that were directly contrary: and therefore, I am marked out, like <hi>Cain,</hi> with a trembling conſcience: I have ſold Chriſt and his Cauſe, like <hi>Judas,</hi> for gaine and ſafety; and this my ſin was committed both with knowledge and againſt it: yea, I have ſinned preſumptuouſly; and then the Scripture is cleare in my ſentence,</q>

            <p>And now, if all theſe conſiderations both of Weſterne ſins and ſufferings doe not lie heavie enough upon our hearts, to breake them before the Lord this day; then I have yet <hi>one talent</hi> of Lead <hi>more</hi> which I would caſt in; and it may alſo be digged out of my Text,

            <p>Firſt,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>The Riſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi>
               </note> conſider the riſe and <hi>originall</hi> of our deſolations. The Weſt is in great part a kind of great <hi>promontory,</hi> or ſomwhat like a Peninſula; it is a Country partly hugg'd in the armes of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> upon the North; partly ſleeved up by the <hi>narrow ſea,</hi> upon the South; ſo that for people and ſcituation, it was like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Aegyptian Alexandria,
<note place="margin">Nahum. 3.8.</note> which is thus deſcribed by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum: Art thou better then populous (or nouriſhnig)</hi> No, <hi>that was ſcituate among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whoſe rampart was the ſea, and her wall was from the ſea?</hi> Our ſhips and Ocean were heretofore accounted (and too much gloried in) as the ſtrength of great Britaine; and we were
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:125082:36"/>wont to ſay, that this Iſland had a wall of wood, and a moate of ſeas about her; but the Weſt above other parts might have boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her greateſt ſhare in this defence; for it was a Country by ſcituation (as it were) <hi>cut out</hi> for ſafety and ſecurity; ſo that I have heard ſome wiſe Eaſterne men ſaying, that they did even en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie our <hi>Geographicall happineſſe,</hi> in the beginning of theſe troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les; and indeed wee had litle cauſe to feare either any commotion from within, all the five Counties ſtanding generally right at firſt; or any invader from without,
<note n="*" place="margin">Devon &amp; Cornwall.</note> two of theſe five Counties, and a part of the third
<note n="*" place="margin">Somerſet</note> being almoſt cut off from the whole kingdome, and onely a neck of land, litle more then
<note n="*" place="margin">from Lime to Bridge. water.</note> twenty miles over, doth unite them as a <hi>Peninſula</hi> to the maine. Hence it was, that many of our people did ſtand ſtudying which way 'twas poſſible for an enemie to come in, and over-run us; yea, and generally we of the Weſt may now take up that of the lamenting Prophet in this point:
<note place="margin">Lamen. 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>All the inhabitants of the world would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, that the adverſary and the enemie ſhould have entred into the gates of [our] Ieruſalem.</hi> And, to give glory to God, wee muſt all confeſſe, that this ſea-confidence hath been one great ſin of this kingdome: and as the whole land is now ſcourged for it, by a ſword coming out of 'its owne bowels; ſo eſpecially the Weſterne parts, where <hi>a litle cloud like a mans hand,</hi> ariſing out of that unhappy
<note n="*" place="margin">Sherborn.</note> 
               <hi>caſtle,</hi> and meeting with many vaporing exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> did in a ſhort time darken our heaven, and anon was poured downe upon all thoſe Counties in a ſhower of blood; in which, the <hi>garments</hi> of our miſerable Country-men are lamentably <hi>rouled</hi> to this day; yea, and although wee did continually endeavour with our prayers, perſons, purſes, as with ſo many buckets, to draine and ſtanch our diſtreſſed Counties; yet did the waves ſtill flow in and ariſe <hi>from the ancles to the knees, from the knees to the loynes,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.</note> untill they became ſuch a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as could not be paſſed.</hi> And thus hath our <hi>affliction</hi> ariſen as it were <hi>out of the duſt,</hi> our <hi>deſtruction</hi> (as the kingdomes) was (ſtrangely) <hi>of our ſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 45.6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>and our caſting downe from the midſt of us:</hi> and all this is happened unto us, <hi>That men may know</hi> (ſaith God by his Prophet) <hi>from the riſing of the Sunne, and from the Weſt, that there is none beſides me: I am the Lord, and there is none elſe. I forme the light, and create darkeneſſe: I make peace, and create evill: I the Lord doe all theſe things,</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:125082:37"/>
            <p>Secondly,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of it; Loſt labours in</hi>
               </note> conſider the <hi>growth</hi> and <hi>progreſſe</hi> of our ruine: Oh the great labours, both in doings and ſufferings, that were laid out by the people of the Weſt! Oh the vaſt treaſures that were by them expended, for the defence of this cauſe and themſelves! and yet, alas, all theſe labours (me thinks) have been (as the Prophet ſpeaketh) but as <hi>labouring in the very fire:</hi>

Let us therefore now looke into this matter more fully; partly for the farther ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch as doe deſire true information; but chiefly for our owne farther humiliation under that heavie hand of God, which hath extraordinarily touched us.
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
               </note> Firſt then, ſhall wee looke to our ſtrong and labourious <hi>fortifications,</hi> and the ſuccesleſneſſe and loſſe of thoſe, that therein wee may read (as our owne activitie, ſo) the Lords diſpleaſure againſt us? Then give me leave ſhortly to view ſome of the works of the five Weſterne Counties:
<note place="margin">Cornwall.</note> And 1. as for lamentable <hi>Cornwall;</hi> I muſt ſay of that, at preſent, as ſometimes <hi>Jacob</hi> of his loſt <hi>Ioſeph:</hi> Cornwall <hi>is not,</hi> though even that County was not loſt without ſome hearty ſtruglings of the honeſt party; and therefore I hope to ſee 'its riſing againe, <hi>as life from the dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Devon.</note> 2. As for the <hi>greateſt</hi> of all theſe five Counties, in it <hi>one</hi> large <hi>City,</hi> and <hi>foure</hi> great <hi>Townes,</hi> all accounted as mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, were ſtrongly fortified and well defended; but that labour hath proved but a labouring in the fire, all thoſe places being now loſt, except one poor <hi>Plymouth</hi> onely. 3. In the <hi>third County,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Somerſet. Briſtoll. Taunton &amp; Bridgwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               </note> (which is the ſecond in extent) there, that greateſt <hi>City</hi> of the Weſt, with other her two <hi>daughters,</hi> which are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Cities alſo, were with great ſummes of money made garriſons; but every of them ſince that time, (as well mother as daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) have been taken, ſack't, undone; though the Lord hath given us back the <hi>ſhell,</hi> the <hi>neſt,</hi> I meane the dwelling houſes or buildings of
<note n="*" place="margin">Taunton. Dorſet. Poole. Wareham. Dorcheſter Weymouth, Lyme.</note> one of thoſe Townes againe; but alas the <hi>kernell,</hi> the <hi>birds,</hi> the ſubſtance are gone and flowen. 4. In the <hi>fourth County,</hi> (to proceed Geographically) <hi>five Townes</hi> neere the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts were made defenſible and garriſon'd; I might call them the <hi>Parliamentary Cinque ports of Dorſet:</hi> but of theſe the greater number and the ſtronger have alſo been taken by the enemie,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:125082:37"/>though God hath given them to us againe. 5. And finally,
<note place="margin">Marlebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough.</note> as for the <hi>laſt</hi> of thoſe Counties, 'its beſt defended, and the moſt fighting towne, is now made a principall quarter of the Enemie: So much concerning fortifications. Or ſecondly, ſhall we ſpeake of faithfull and <hi>valiant</hi> endeavours of ſelf-defence, for the Parliamentary cauſe, <note place="margin">2. Valiant ſelfe-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, in ſuſtaining of ſieges. Exon.</note> by ſuſtaining of long ſieges? even herein the Weſt may compare (if compariſons be not odious) with moſt Cities, Townes, Caſtles, or houſes in the land. Take an inſtance in every of thoſe three: 1. Amongſt <hi>City-ſieges,</hi> remember that of <hi>Exon,</hi> which for the ſpace of about <hi>fifteen weeks</hi> together, did faithfully conflict and ſtruggle with a double diſeaſe: partly with a ſtrong, crafty, peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentiall enemie, encompaſſing her without; and partly with a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant putrid fever in her owne blood within; and all this in the loweſt and moſt <hi>hopeleſſe</hi> juncture of <hi>time,</hi> that ever this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament did ſee, or I hope ſhall ſee, untill our perfect deliverance: <note place="margin">Deut. 22.26, 27.</note> and therefore that City, though it be now raviſhed by ſtrangers, may truely be ſaid to have kept her <hi>virgin</hi>-honour and <note n="*" place="margin">Fidelis in aternum.</note> 
               <hi>motto</hi> ſtill, becauſe ſhee cryed out for help, though no man came to her reſcue. Amongſt <hi>Towne-ſieges,</hi> I might ſay much concerning the ſtoutneſſe and longanimity, of <hi>Poole</hi> and <hi>Dartmouth,</hi> and perhaps of ſome other places; but becauſe I have promiſed but one inſtance in this particular, let our Chronicle of theſe times bid poſterity to give the Crowne of perſeverance to conſtant <hi>Plymouth;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Plimouth.</note> whoſe ſiege may beare almoſt the ſame (that is as long a) date as the preſent wars. It is now about two yeares ſince (as I remember) that the habituall Leaguer, or, rather, <hi>Plantation</hi> of the enemie before that towne did begin: and although there have been ſome inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, yet I doe queſtion, whether thoſe (as the Lord diſpoſed them) have made more for the greater reliefe or diſtreſſe of that place: And in all this time, both flatteries, treacheries, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of all kinds were uſed; yea, and the preſence of abuſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty it ſelfe, was brought to prove and crowne the wiſedome, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, courage of that Garriſon. Finally, amongſt <hi>Caſtle-Sieges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Warder Caſtle.</note> that of <hi>Warder</hi> in <hi>Wilts</hi> will be famous to poſterity, both for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and active valour, to the utmoſt. So much concerning length of Sieges.</p>
            <p>But once more,
<note place="margin">Marle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</note> if you look to hot ſervice and <hi>fiery ſtormings</hi> (as they call them) then take but two inſtances: Firſt, in the tempeſt at <hi>Marleborough,</hi> that was admirably ſuſtained, untill the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:125082:38"/>were over-power'd with lead, fire, and numbers. But chiefly in that great wonder of <hi>little Lyme</hi> in <hi>Dorſet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lime.</note> which having in it but eleven hundred Souldiers, did not onely ſuſtaine, but ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repulſed a Leaguer of no leſſe then (by their owne confeſſion) ſixe thouſand Enemies; whoſe Demi-cannon, and other Ordnance played unceflantly upon their weake and thin line, for full 8. weeks together; whilſt the Souldiery in the Towne, having digged pits, (or graves rather) for themſelves, under their line, in the earth, to ſhelter themſelves from the Ordnance, did there eate, and drinke, and lodge, and dwell in mire and clay to the end of that ſiege; So that not onely their owne judicious,

Many more particulars, with their inſtances, might be added, to ſhew the extraordinary endeavours of the Weſt to preſerve it ſelfe for King and Parliament. But that which ought to breake our hearts in all that hath been ſaid, is to conſider, that, notwithſtanding all this labour, charge, courage, heartines, <hi>wee have ſpent our ſtrength in vaine and for nought.</hi> Our fore did ſtill run, and ceaſed not, untill wee were become (as at this day) the moſt miſerable parts of the Kingdome; ſo that the Weſt muſt neceſſarily and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially cry out, <hi>The hand of God hath touched me.</hi> This was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Conſideration.</p>

Others <hi>more particular,</hi> and as it were independent, taken onely from the ſubjects, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of our compaſſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt in <hi>generall:</hi> as we have already found in this book of <hi>Iob,</hi> a paterne, and <hi>parallel</hi> of <hi>miſerie;</hi> ſo may wee fetch out from thence a <hi>Copie</hi> of <hi>compaſſion,</hi> even from the pitie of <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends; it is deſcribed Chap. 2. in three Verſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Verſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:125082:41"/>11, 12, 13. They doe containe the viſit of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends: in which we may obſerve, 1. The occaſion. 2. The ground 3. The end, and intendment of their coming.</p>
            <p>The <hi>occaſion</hi> of their viſit,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</hi> Verſe 11.</note> was the <hi>report</hi> of all the evill that was come upon <hi>Iob: Now when</hi> Iobs <hi>three friends heard of all the evill that was come upon him, then they came:</hi> This may hint unto us the duty of <hi>enquiring,</hi> and liſtning after our diſtreſſed friends and Country, which ſhall be the firſt branch of reall pitie.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ground</hi> of this viſit was a mutuall agreement,
<note place="margin">2. <hi>The ground.</hi>
               </note> or a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie compact made between them; <hi>for they had made an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment together to come, &amp;c.</hi> This doth intimate unto us, the duty of <hi>aſſembling,</hi> and conſulting together, for the good of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted brethren, which will be the ſecond branch of friendly pitie.</p>

            <p>The firſt branch of reall pity,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Duty, Enquiry, &amp;c.</hi> Iob. 2.11.</note> is to <hi>hearken out,</hi> and make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after our diſtreſſed brethren. Thus <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> were induced to pitie <hi>Iob,</hi> by the hearing of their eares: <hi>When they heard of all this evill that was come upon him, then they came every one from his owne place, &amp;c.</hi> Marke, the very <hi>hear-ſay,</hi> or report of the afflictions of friends ought both to take our eares, and to move our hearts. But, alas for the <hi>Adder-like</hi> deafeneſſe of multitudes now amongſt us, that will not heare in that eare (as we ſay) for feare leſt their hearts, and then their purſes ſhould be pickt open; for they doe interpret every ſad relation, to be the preface to a petition: Yea, many men are (like the people neer the falls of <hi>Nylus</hi>) growne deafe by the continuall noiſe of dolefull reports: Surely the Lord will boare ſuch eares at laſt. Others there are, which doe account it a cheaper and a <hi>wiſer way,</hi> not to beleeve any ſad reports at all but generally to cry them downe, as falſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:125082:41"/>and uncertaine pamphlets, rather then to be at the paine of letting them into their hearts; and theſe are like churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> which did chooſe rather to call <hi>David</hi> a run-away, and to ſuſpect the truth of his meſſengers, then to be at the charge of rewarding and relieving them. The ſword may one day find out theſe men alſo.</p>
            <p>But chiefly wee muſt obſerve from this duty of enquiry, that wee ought to have our eares open to receive, yea, our mouthes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to <hi>enquire</hi> after all the evill that doth come upon our friends. Good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> did not only hearken what tidings from <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but (ſo great a Courtier as he was) he made enquiry after newes:
<note place="margin">Nehem. 1.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>And I asked them concerning the</hi> Jewes <hi>that had eſcaped, which were left of the captivitie, &amp;c.</hi> It ſeemes he was both earneſt and buſy, in his interrogatories; for ſo you may read the words; I asked <hi>concerning</hi> the Jewes, <hi>concerning</hi> the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>concerning</hi> Jeruſalem: Here is queſtion upon queſtion, and another upon that againe, concerning, concerning, concerning; juſt as your vehement inquiſitors uſe to doe; yea, he doth enquire after every particular too, as the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the remnant, <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> Let this example ſhame the faces of all ſuch <hi>Epicures,</hi> as cannot liſten after the condition of their ſuffering fellow-members: Surely themſelves are but as the <hi>belly</hi> in the publike body,
<note place="margin">Venter auribus caret.</note> of which wee ſay, that it <hi>hath no eares;</hi> and I ſhall leave with them that juſt proverb of the holy Ghoſt:
<note place="margin">Prov. 21.13.</note> 
               <hi>Who ſo ſtoppeth his eares at the cry of the poor, he alſo ſhall cry himſelfe, but ſhall not be heard.</hi> But as for us, (my brethren) let us be like unto pious old <hi>Ely,</hi> who, although he had loſt his eyes, yet doth uſe his eares to the utmoſt, in liſtning after the condition of the Arke, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the field: <hi>Ely ſate upon a ſeat by the way ſide, watching:</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.14, 15.</note> Yet it is added; <hi>his eyes were dimme, that he could not ſee.</hi> A ſtrange watchman that had no eyes; but it ſeems that he did watch with his <hi>eares,</hi> to heare what newes from the armies; ſo let us even pant with trembling hearts after the publike occurrences: And here I cannot but complaine, and grieve, to conſider how much the ſtream of perfect and true intelligence (that ſhould be to our dayly prayers, as water to the mill) is continually obſtructed, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and broken in this great City, by manifold printed malignities, falſities, and miſtakes. This was the firſt branch of the reall pitie, from the example of <hi>Iobs</hi> three friends.
<note place="margin">2. <hi>Duty, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The Second, was to <hi>aſſemble</hi> and <hi>conſult</hi> together, for the good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:125082:42"/>of our afflicted brethren: Thus <hi>Eliphaz, Bildad,</hi> and <hi>Zophar,</hi> did make a mutuall <hi>appointment together to come, &amp;c.</hi> Learne wee hence, the neceſſary leſſon of <hi>voluntary meetings,</hi> for the benefit of our diſtreſſed abſent brethren and Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jobs</hi> friends were neither conſtrained nor called together, but their act was both free and unanimous. Let all our <hi>unſociable,</hi> untuneable Weſterne exiles, conſider this patterne; even all thoſe that are backward to friendly conſultations and deliberations for the good of their native Country; but too forward to cenſure and prejudicate all ſuch as doe promote them: Surely, there were not more <hi>excuſes</hi> made by thoſe ungratefull gueſts,
<note place="margin">Luke 14.18, 19, 20.</note> which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to that Goſpel <hi>marriage feaſt,</hi> then may be heard from ſome of us, when we are invited to meet together for the publike good: the <hi>purchaſe,</hi> the <hi>oxen,</hi> the <hi>wife,</hi> pride, profit, and pleaſure, doe all bring in their ſeverall put-offs; <q>
                  <hi>One</hi> man will tell you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, that the meeting will be <hi>to no purpoſe:</hi>
               </q> Who made him a Prophet? but if thou art ſure of that (O diviner,) then thou oughteſt the rather to come thither, or at leaſt to appoint ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, thereby to make up an effectuall meeting. <hi>Another</hi> man <q>takes <hi>exception,</hi> becauſe ſuch a one did appoint the conſultation: But why hadſt not thou prevented him? Beſides, I thinke it is lawfull for any man to beſtow his paines freely towards the dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a common field. A <hi>third man</hi> objecteth (pettiſhly) that he <hi>never heard</hi> of the meeting before, neither hath hee as yet been told the buſines. Why, who was bound to be the beadle to give you notice? who is paid for that ſervice? Me thinks thou might'ſt rather account it a mercy from God, and a courteſie from man, that thou doeſt by any meanes heare of any opportunity of doing good at any time; nay, (as I conceive) thy ſelfe art bound to aske and inquire, after ſuch occaſions of ſerving thy Country; and me thinks there is Scripture for it, <hi>Whatſoever thy hand find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to doe,</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:125082:42"/>of ſpirit? Will we needs have another whipping with ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions for this ſin?

Nay, (and to carry-on the application of my <hi>Punick</hi> Story) they have already treated-away ſome of our moſt conſiderable pieces, as <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Let us now play the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in hope, and to purpoſe: Let us not ſpare the reliques of our eſtates, treaſures, perſons; our houſes, gold and ſilver, haire, heads and all, to redeeme all our temporall, naturall, ſpirituall goods againe. As for the <hi>iſſues,</hi> let them be wholly left to the good pleaſure of our God; perchance it may pleaſe him to make good unto us, Weſtern Exiles, that promiſe by <hi>Zephaniah,</hi> namely,

               <hi>To leave in the midſt of</hi> the Weſt <hi>an afflicted and poore people, and they ſhall truſt in the Name of the Lord.</hi> Surely, ſuch a mercy as this would be great, and precious to broken hearts: Or, perhaps (which ſeemeth ſharper) hee hath in his ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe juſtly decreed, that unworthy wee, of this preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall not returne to conquer or ſee againe our native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; though, perchance, our children after us may obtaine that favour: But, though it be thus, yet let us labour to <hi>conquer our ſelves,</hi> and our own inordinate deſires; ('tis as great a mercy to want drought, as to have drinke;) let us prepare to ſee the pleaſed face of Chriſt at laſt: And for preſent, ſtrive we to attain to hearts like that of <hi>David,</hi> who, when hee was flying from his <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> from his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> yea, from <hi>Ordinances</hi> and all, yet could ſay unto <hi>Zadok,</hi>

               <hi>Carry back the Arke of God into the City: if I ſhall find favour in the eyes of the Lord, hee will bring mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and ſhew me both it and his habitation: But if hee ſay thus, I have no delight in thee; behold, here am I, let him doe to mee as it ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> Such a depth of ſelfe-ſubmiſſion as this, is the higheſt ſtep of ſelfe-advancement.
